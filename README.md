## 1. Project Overview

This project performs:

- Hyperspectral Image (HSI) Classification
- Domain Generalization / Domain Adaptation
- Progressive Spectral Learning
- Contrastive Learning

# 3. Important Concepts

## Hyperspectral Image (HSI)

Normal RGB image:

```text
Height × Width × 3
```

HSI image:

```text
Height × Width × Spectral Bands
```

Example:

```text
610 × 340 × 102
```

Meaning:
- Height = 610
- Width = 340
- Spectral Bands = 102

Each pixel contains a spectral signature.

---

# 4. Dataset Loading

## Function

```python
get_dataset()
```

Loads:
- HSI image
- Ground truth labels
- RGB bands
- Ignored labels
- Color palette

---

## Returned Variables

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| img_src | Source HSI cube |
| gt_src | Source labels |
| img_tar | Target HSI cube |
| gt_tar | Target labels |
| RGB_BANDS | RGB visualization bands |
| ignored_labels | labels ignored during training |

---

# 5. Ground Truth (GT)

Ground truth contains class labels.

Example:

```text
0 = unlabeled
1 = water
2 = tree
3 = soil
```

Shape:

```text
[Height, Width]
```

---

# 6. Normalization

## Purpose

Neural networks train better with normalized data.

---

## Step 1 — Max Normalization

```python
img = img / img.max()
```

Converts values into:

```text
0 → 1 range
```

---

## Step 2 — L2 Spectral Normalization

```python
img = img / img_temp
```

Purpose:
- Normalize each spectral vector
- Focus on spectral shape instead of brightness

---

# 7. Why Convert 3D → 2D → 3D?

Original:

```text
[H, W, Bands]
```

Converted:

```text
[H×W, Bands]
```

Reason:
- Easier vector operations
- Easier normalization

After normalization:
- reshaped back to original HSI cube

---

# 8. Padding

## Why Padding Needed

Patch extraction near image borders is impossible without padding.

Example:

```text
Need 13×13 patch around border pixel
```

Padding solves this.

---

## Image Padding

```python
np.pad(..., mode='symmetric')
```

Uses mirrored borders.

---

## GT Padding

```python
np.pad(..., mode='constant')
```

Uses zeros.

Reason:
- Outside image should be ignored.

---

# 9. Patch Extraction

## Patch Size

Example:

```text
13 × 13
```

Each patch contains:
- spatial information
- spectral information

---

## Final Patch Shape

```text
[102, 13, 13]
```

---

# 10. sample_gt()

## Purpose

Splits labels into:
- training labels
- testing labels

---

## Output

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| train_gt | sparse train GT |
| test_gt | sparse test GT |

---

## Example

Original GT:

```text
1 2 1
3 1 2
```

Train GT:

```text
1 0 0
0 1 2
```

---

# 11. HyperX Dataset

## Purpose

Custom PyTorch dataset for:
- patch extraction
- augmentation
- tensor conversion

---

## Main Responsibilities

- Extract patches
- Extract center label
- Apply augmentations
- Return tensors

---

# 12. DataLoader

## Purpose

Creates mini-batches.

---

## Example

```python
x.shape = [512,102,13,13]
```

Meaning:
- Batch size = 512
- Bands = 102
- Patch size = 13×13

---

# 13. Progressive Spectral Learning

## Main Idea

Do NOT learn all bands immediately.

Instead:

```text
few bands
↓
more bands
↓
all bands
```

---

## current_step

```python
current_step =
int(epoch/(pre_epoch/layers_num))+1
```

Determines current spectral stage.

---

## Example

| Epoch | Stage |
|---|---|
| 0-19 | Stage 1 |
| 20-39 | Stage 2 |
| 40-59 | Stage 3 |

---

# 14. Generators (g1, g2)

## Purpose

Create:
- enhanced spectral features
- progressive spectral representations

---

## Outputs

| Output | Meaning |
|---|---|
| x_g1 | enhanced features |
| x_down1 | progressive/downsampled features |

---

# 15. Discriminators (d1, d2)

## Purpose

Classify patches and extract embeddings.

---

## Outputs

| Output | Meaning |
|---|---|
| p | class logits |
| z | feature embeddings |

---

# 16. Embeddings

Example:

```text
[512,128]
```

Meaning:
- 512 samples
- 128-dimensional learned feature vectors

---

# 17. Contrastive Learning

## Main Idea

Same-class features:
- become close

Different-class features:
- become far

---

## Example

```text
water(source)
≈
water(target)
```

but:

```text
water
≠
tree
```

---

# 18. Contrastive Loss

```python
con_criterion(...)
```

Purpose:
- align embeddings
- improve feature clustering

---

# 19. Classification Loss

Usually:

```python
CrossEntropyLoss
```

Purpose:
- correct class prediction

---

# 20. Adversarial Alignment

## Main Idea

Make:
- source features
- target features

look similar.

---

## Goal

Learn domain-invariant representations.

---

# 21. detach()

## Purpose

Stops gradient flow.

---

## Example

Without detach:

```text
Loss
↓
Embedding
↓
Generator updated
```

With detach:

```text
Loss
↓
Embedding
STOP
```

---

# 22. backward()

## Purpose

Compute gradients.

---

## Flow

```text

| Kappa | Agreement quality |
| F1-score | balance of precision/recall |
| TPR | class recall |

---

# 26. Kappa Score

Measures:
- prediction agreement quality

Better than raw accuracy.

---

## Formula Idea

```text
(actual agreement - random agreement)
-------------------------------------
(1 - random agreement)
```

---

# 27. state_dict()

Contains:
- learned weights
- biases
- parameters

---

# 28. Saving Models

```python
torch.save(...)
```

Creates:

```text
best_g1.pth
best_g2.pth
best.pth
```

---

# 29. Main Training Flow

```text
FOR each epoch:
